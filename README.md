# Predicting Sleep Quality

Sleep Cycle is an IOS and Android mobile appication that utalizes the phone's microphone to record sleep, and wakes you up during an interval of light sleep when you're most rested. 

**The Data** 

RaySleepData.csv was acquired between 2018-2020 and collected through the Sleep Cycle app from my personal iPhone.

KaggleSleepData.csv was aquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/danagerous/undefined) between 2014-2018 and collected through the Sleep Cycle app from Northcube on iOS.

RayJsonData.txt was scraped from the [Sleep Cycle](https://s.sleepcycle.com/) website with my login information.

**Updating the Data**

Since I still currently use this app, I wanted to continousley scrape the new data from the Sleep Cycle website and add a new row to the RaySleepData.csv file to keep an up-to-date model.
