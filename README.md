# Predicting Sleep Quality

Sleep happens in stages during the night. It is split into non-REM (Stages 1-3) and REM sleep. Combined, they last about 90 minutes, or one sleep cycle. A good night's sleep consists of 5-6 complete sleep cycles. 

Stage 1: Drowsiness. Changeover from wakefullness to sleep. On average lasting 15 mins.

Stage 2: Light sleep and body relaxation to prepare for deep sleep.

Stage 3: Deep sleep and where the body gets the most recovery and memory formation.

REM Sleep: Or Rapid Eye Movement Sleep. Close to wakefullness, dreaming and memory consolidation occur here.

Sleep Cycle is an IOS and Android mobile appication that utalizes the phone's microphone to record sleep, and wakes you up when you're most rested, in between the 90-minute sleep cycles.

## The Data

*RaySleepData.csv* was acquired between 2018-2020 and collected through the Sleep Cycle app from my personal iPhone.

*KaggleSleepData.csv* was aquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/danagerous/undefined) between 2014-2018 and collected through the Sleep Cycle app from Northcube on iOS.

*RayJsonData.txt* was scraped from the [Sleep Cycle](https://s.sleepcycle.com/) website with my login information.

## Updating the Data

Since I still currently use this app, I wanted to continousley scrape the new data from the Sleep Cycle website and add a new row to the RaySleepData.csv file to keep an up-to-date model.
